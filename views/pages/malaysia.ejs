          <p>
            On March 8, 2014, the flight Malaysia 370 departed from Kuala Lumpur
            International Airport for Beijing Capital International airport. All
            of its 224 passengers and 12 crew members on board left the airport
            at 12:05 am, never arriving at their destination. The aircraft’s
            last transmission to the Aircraft Communication Addressing and
            Reporting System(ACARS) was at 01:07 am. And the aircraft’s last
            communication to aircraft control was at 01:21 am. After its last
            communication to the aircraft went offline, never to be seen or
            heard from again.

            The theories of what happened to Malaysia Flight 370 bombarded the
            public. Many think the flight was hijacked. This could explain the
            loss of communication from the aircraft to aircraft control. Others
            believe the pilot had lost control. But this would not explain the
            sudden silence from the aircraft. The remains of the aircraft were
            never found in the Indian Ocean, leaving many spectators to question
            what really happened on the flight.
