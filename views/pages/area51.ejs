          <p class="lead">What really happens at Area 51?</p>
  
          <p>Area 51 is a government facility owned by the United States Airforce based in Southern Nevada. As stated from Britannica, “ it's only confirmed use is as a flight testing facility.” But there are many conspiracies on what the facility actually is.</p>
  
          <p>Many theorize the facility recovered alien ships and inspect them for experimentation. 
            Specifically, abnormal amounts of “UFO” sightings have been reported around the facility.</p>
  
          <p>The government spoke out about these sightings saying it was only aircraft testing. As the accusations of “UFO” sightings became popularized, more evidence of the sightings was distributed publicly. Decades later, the infamous Area 51 raid gained popularity with over 1 million followers.</p>
  
          <p>This raid's main objective was to “Save dem aliens” from the government. Though the military quickly dispersed the raid, the mystery of aliens in Area 51 continues to be unsolved.</p>
